# CROWD-SOURCING PLATFORM FOR NATIONAL VIRTUAL LIBRARY OF INDIA

National virtual library of India (NVLI) is a platform for storing digital assets of India. The digital assets uploaded to this library have to be made searchable. For this purpose appropriate metadata tags need to be associated with every digital asset. The best person to tag the assets is the creator. However most of the creators leave them untagged making it inappropriate for search engines. The crowd-sourcing platform will distribute the tagging among many users thus facilitating the search engines.
